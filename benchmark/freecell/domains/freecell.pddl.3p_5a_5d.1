;;; Description
;;; ------------
;;; Freecell is a solitaire game that comes with Windows.
;;; If you haven't seen it before:
;;;  One has 8 columns of cards, 4 freecells and 4 homecells. The
;;;  cards start in "random" (random according to MS's brain damaged RNG)
;;;  piles in the 8 columns. We can move a card in the following ways: 
;;;  1. we can move any card that is on top of a column to an empty free
;;;     cell. The free cells only take one card each.
;;;  2. we can move any card from a free cell or from top of a column to
;;;  a home cell if that home cell contains a card of the same suit
;;;  and is one lower in value (aces have value 1, Jacks 11, Queens
;;;  12, Kings 13, and to make things more symmetric we start the
;;;  homecells off containing "phone" cards with value 0.
;;;  3. we can move any card from the  top of a column or from a
;;;  freecell to the top of another column if that column currently holds
;;;  a card with an opposite colour suit that has one higher
;;;  value. 
;;;  4. we can move any card from a free cell or on top of a column to a
;;;  new column if there are less than 8 columns.
;;; The aim is to get all of the card home. The problems show quite a
;;; good variety of difficulty. 
;;; With macro-moves  (actions that generate worm-holes in the search
;;; space) and hand-tailored heurisics tlplan is able to solve about
;;; 90% of the randomly generated games. Unfortunately, the
;;; macro-moves need action descriptions that include recursive 
;;; updates...i.e., beyond adl, and the heurisics need functions and
;;; arithmetic also beyond adl.
;;;
;;; However the original version of the domain was done by two
;;; students in my AI class, and without heuristics and marco moves
;;; they were able to solve problems containing reduced number of
;;; cards in each suit. 
;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;; Cards are represented by the symbols 
;;;		ca, c2, ..., cj, cq, ck. - clubs
;;;		da, d2, ..., dj, dq, dk. - diamonds
;;;		ha, h2, ..., hj, hq, gk. - hearts
;;;		sa, s2, ..., sj, sq, sk. - spaces
;;;		(c0, d0, h0, s0 indicate an empty card of a certain suit).
;;; 
;;; Where:
;;;		c = clubs, d = diamonds, h = hearts, s = spades.
;;;		a = ace, j = jack, q = queen, k = king.
;;;
;;; Static Predicates (In Tlplan these were functions)
;;; 
;;; (value card val)   --- the face value of the card. (1, ..., 13)
;;; (suit card st)     --- the suit of the card. (c, d, h, s)
;;;   e.g., (value ca 1) (suit ca c)
;;; (successor n' n)   --- n' = n+1, for n=0,...,12, n'=1,...,13
;;;                        a cheap and dirty way to avoid using
;;;                        numbers. 
;;;                        Note 0 does not have a predecessor. This
;;;                        serves act as > 0 precondition
;;;
;;;
;;; Dynamic Predicates:
;;;
;;; (on card1 card2)	-- card1 is on card2
;;; (incell card)	--- card is in a freecell.
;;; (clear card)	--- card is clear (i.e., on top of a column).
;;; (cellspace n)	--- there are n free freecells.
;;;                                n = 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4
;;; (colspace n)	--- there are n free columns. n=0,..,8
;;; (home card)		--- card is a top card in a home stack.
;;;			    we use the special (home c0),
;;;			    (home d0), (home h0), (home s0).
;;;			    to indicate that home is empty for a
;;;			    particular suit.
;;; (bottomcol card)	--  card is at the bottom of a stack.
