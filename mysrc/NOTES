- CORE DUMP: c->insert(bvar) in StripsEncoding::supporting_constraints, line 147

- POTENTIAL BUGS: at -i 120 code part, check >>> DUMMY_PRED(null) --- so object V not found
- StripsEncoding::get_bool_var can be optimized? by using gft_conn, instead of gop_conn; and by checking if a ft is not possibly added or deleted by any action
